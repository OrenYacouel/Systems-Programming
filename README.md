# Systems-Programming
**Syllabus**
This course teaches how to be an intelligent user of sophisticated runtime environments. The
programs we design are built to operate in the context of a software environment. Understanding
the interaction between programs and their software environment (runtime environment) is the main
topic ofthis course. The questions addressed during the course are: - What are runtime
environments (RTE)? Examples: Unix OS, Java Virtual Machine, etc. - What are the functionalities
and the structure of RTEs? - What are the possibilities and the limitations for the users of RTE as
programmers? - How do we choose the right tools when designing programs for a given RTE? The
lecture material includes: - Concurrency in multithread/multiprocess environment: how to exploit
concurrency in your programs. - Memory management as viewed from programming languages
(stack model, heap, pointers, copying). - Object Oriented Design - principles and essential tools
(Modern RTEs provide an OO interface - learn what it means). - C++ Programming (Many RTEs
only provide a C or C++ interface - learn to use it). - Interprocess communication using network
protocols over sockets. - Data storage - files, databases (SQL), object serialization. The approach is
top-down -- we start by introducing high-level abstractions for each of the topics (in general using
Java), and then proceed to a more detailled view of the topic (in general using C++ , Unix system
calls, and Scripts). The focus is always on "how to use the RTE resources" and not on "how is the
functionality implemented in the RTE" (which is the focus of the OS course). The practical sessions
complete the lectures by presenting practical and technical details of the material and background
on using program development tools (Makefile, Maven, JUnit, debuggers).
