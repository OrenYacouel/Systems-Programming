# Systems-Programming
The questions addressed during the course are: 
- What are runtime environments (RTE)? 
- How do we choose the right tools when designing programs for a given RTE?
- Concurrency in multithread/multiprocess environment: how to exploit concurrency in your programs. 
- Memory management as viewed from programming languages
  (stack model, heap, pointers, copying).
- Object Oriented Design - principles and essential tools
  (Modern RTEs provide an OO interface),
- C++ Programming
- Interprocess communication using network
  protocols over sockets. 
- Data storage - files, databases (SQL), object serialization.
